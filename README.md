around the world.

● Developed a network analysis dashboard for Zomato, using Python and Data Visualization using
plotly and dash, to visualize the relationships between restaurants on the platform and identify
key influencers and clusters.

the data, resulting in a more accurate representation of the network.

platform, resulting in increased understanding of the key factors driving customer behavior and
restaurant success.

able to gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving customer behavior and restaurant
success, leading to more effective strategies for growth and customer retention.
